								<p>
									As part of Jaan Praks research group at Aalto University and ESA's Hera space mission, I'm responsible for creating a pipeline to clean, calibrate, and analyze hyperspectral image data, and turn it into final data products. The data is received from the ASPECT Hyperspectral Imager on the Hera/Milani space probe. The mission's objective is to gather data about the Didymos binary asteroid system, which was previously in 2022 shot with a DART spacecraft in hopes to succesfully redirect the Didymos's moon, Dimorphos, and to study it's effects. The larger aim is to research this kind of asteroid redirection as a means for planetary defence.
								</p>
                                <p>
                                    My work entails plenty of data analysis and cross-national coordination between teams working on this project. After the data calibration, my pipeline analyzes the hyperspectral images with a convolutional neural network, which will allow us to gain insights into the mineral composition of the target asteroids Didymos and Dimorphos binary asteroid system. The data will be further analyzed with various methods, and documented in scientific literature. The images and derived information will additionally be used to make a reconstructed 3D model containing all related information.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Related to this position, I attended a PDS4 workshop held in ESAC, Madrid, that gave a deep dive into the Planetary Data System (PDS4) archiving format. PDS4 is the latest standard used in NASA's and ESA's scientific data archives.

									As part of this space weathering research project, I created a Convolutional Neural Network enhanced Gaussian Process algorithm for estimating asteroid surface age. The algorithm uses asteroid hyperspectral reflectance spectra to give an age estimate. It stands out as a surprisingly flexible algorithm to predict outcomes even with a sparse training set, as in our case.

							<h5>May 2024 - Aug 2024</h5>
							<p>
								I was hired as a Research Assistant to develop a Gaussian Process (GP) ML model to estimate the age of S/Sq/Q-type asteroid surfaces. The GP model is trained with hyperspectral reflectance data that is acquired from various laboratory tests. This algorithm has potential to be used to analyze hyperspectral asteroid images from future space missions.
							</p>
							<p>
								GP model was selected for this task as it has great potential even with a relatively sparse training dataset like ours. I conducted a comprehensive study in order to select the most optimal model structure, which eventually consisted of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based Feature Extractor, and Hadamard Multitask Regression which are built on top of the base GP model. The GP model uses Constant Mean and Matern Kernel as its base components.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Hadamard Multitask functionality is useful for this algorithm because it can be used to train a separate initial model for each of the different asteroid types, and to combine those models into one single algorithm, which is optimized to benefit from the possible similarities between the asteroid types.
							</p>
							<p>
								I'm proud of the results this model was able to achieve. The results were comparable with an ensemble model that uses CNN, Gradient-Boosting regression, K-Nearest neighbor, Extra-Tree Regression, and Random Forest algorithms. More information can be seen in the future once our report paper is published. In the mean time, there is a link to my Github repository below.

                                The thesis aims to explore some different ways to build data streaming pipelines in the cloud. I develop an end-to-end streaming pipeline that uses real-time stock market data and derives analytics from it. The data is ingested with Kafka, processed with Spark/Databricks, and visualized with PowerBI. All services are built on scalable cloud compute that is able to handle massive volumes of data.

								In this project our team developed a building façade recognition algorithm based on
								semantic segmentation. Multiple different methodologies needed to be implemented and
								combined into one fast algorithm to make it robust against visual variations caused by
								weather, time of day, seasons, and foliage. Additionally, the algorithm had to be
								as efficient as possible to be able to run it seamlessly on a mobile device.
							</p>
							<p>
								The structure of the algorithm consists of the following filtering methodologies: number of stories, feature counting, wall/door color, text matching, roof shape, and wall texture. I specialized to the texture analysis and developed a Local Binary Pattern algorithm that filters images based on texture similarity. The results were deemed satisfactory by the customer. More detais can be seen in the project report.
